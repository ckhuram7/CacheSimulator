This is my Project 3 for ECE 2500. I wrote it using Qt

To run the code simply go into the directory where
the projet is saved and on the command line type:

./simulate *name of testfile without extension*

and the code should output to a page titled the same
thing as the input.

If for whatever reason it will not run, I have also
put the actual source files in there, so worst comes 
to worst you can make a new project in Qt and run it
from the command line there.

As far as things that work and dont work, everything
should work except the column for cache to memory. I
was having issues with the dirty bit part of the code.
I worked very hard on this and hope that you will
see that and it will reclect in my grade.

Thank you for a great semester!
